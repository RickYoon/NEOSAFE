### Background: The Need for Improving Web3 User Experience

<br>
In the web3 ecosystem, there is a pressing need to enhance the user experience when it comes to service authentication and key management. Cumbersome service authentication reduces user onboarding rates, and failures in key management can lead to the loss of assets. <br><br>To address this issue, we can draw inspiration from the experiences of web2. In web2, we conveniently access services using our existing authentication methods. Even if it is inconvenient when making payments and financial transactions, we use additional authentication methods to complete the transactions.
<br><br>
Recently, other blockchain networks have successfully applied this customer experience to web3, yielding tangible results. For instance, by implementing social logins, web3auth has increased user onboarding rates by 35% compared to conventional methods. Additionally, multi-signature wallets with 2FA have already attracted deposits totaling 52 billion dollars.

### The Problem We Aim to Solve

<br>
Based on these insights, we have assessed the current state of the NEO ecosystem. An analysis of the most recent 1,000 transactions revealed the absence of multi-signature transactions. Furthermore, from a user perspective, there is currently a lack of infrastructure to utilize smart wallet features. Drawing from examples on other chains, it's evident that features like multi-signature functionality and account abstraction are in high demand from users, making them essential components of the blockchain ecosystem.
<br><br>

### Our Proposed Solution

<br>

To address this issue, we intend to offer a wallet service that supports account abstraction and multi-signature functionality. Through this approach, users can seamlessly onboard to services, and they can also manage their assets more securely, using dual authentication methods to mitigate the risk of asset loss in case of key management failures.
