## The problem Linkrypto solves
In 2023, a series of incidents in South Korea involving centralized finance (CeFi) deposit services, managing funds exceeding 3 billion dollar, led to a significant shift in regulations. These events are anticipated to render CeFi deposit services legally unfeasible. Consequently, individuals seeking to deposit funds face a dilemma. They are compelled to interact directly with decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, as an alternative solution. However, DeFi, while promising, presents formidable barriers for novice investors and carries inherent risks.

To address this challenge, we have leveraged ERC-4337 technology to develop a user-friendly and secure solution. With our innovative platform, users no longer need to entrust their valuable assets to third parties. Instead, they gain the ability to invest directly, safely, and effectively. Our product aims to empower individuals to manage their investments independently, safeguarding their assets while simplifying the investment process.

## Challenges I ran into
ERC-4337
To Enhance user security and flexibility within the ERC-4337 framework, it was essential to allow for the dynamic alteration of smart wallet contracts. However, I am relatively new to ERC-4337 and have time-constrained. Consequently, I sought inspiration from existing contracts such as Kernel, Simple, and Soulwallet.

MPC (Multi-Party Computation)
Initially, I lacked a fundamental understanding of MPC technology, which required some dedicated learning. Due to time constraints, my focus shifted from comprehension to prioritizing practical implementation.

Metamask Snap
In the early stages, there was a scarcity of documentation and resources. To overcome this hurdle, I leveraged the well-crafted services of Tenderly as a foundation, thus effectively addressing the issue.
